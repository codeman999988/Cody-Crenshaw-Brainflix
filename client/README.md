This project is Brainflix.  It is being built using react.

It is a mock-website that represents a video site that has different videos that a user can watch.  The site also will allow users to upload their own videos.  This site is at it's final version, it has been built in three distinct sprints..  

It has limited functionality as it can not currently play videos or perform searches.

It is populated using a backend build with express.

This version's functionality includes:
1. Populating the page with data pulled from the backend server.
2. Comment section that allows users to post comments to the server, and delete them.
3. Upload page that can load video objects to the backend.
4. Video uploads and comment posts persist after the server goes down.

I attempted some of the diving deeper sections, and I had hoped to accomplish more but was distracted many hours providing help to other students.  I included comment posting and deleting functionality.  I had intended to blow the world away and actually include the ability to upload videos, but my attempts to figure that out ultimately proved fruitless.

I fixed most of the styling issues that plagued the sprint 2 version of the site, and utilized @use for importing partials instead of using the deprecated @import.  This, surprisingly, was a challenge, as I didn't know why earlier @use wasn't working for me.

Turns out you have to install sass in your NPM xD.

I still included the upload video form elements that I attempted to use.  It changes the styling somewhat, but it looks much more like the final version that I would have liked to have submitted.

If I had another day I would implement likes functionality, a dynamic views counter, a functioning video player, and if I had another week I would attempt the holy grail of video file upload functionality.

Check out the comments xD!
