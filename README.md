This project is Brainflix.  It is being built using react.

It is a mock-website that represents a video site that has different videos that a user can watch.  The site also will allow users to upload their own videos.  This site is currently unfinished, it will be built in three distinct sprints.  The current version is sprint two.  

It has limited functionality as it can not currently play videos or perform searches.

This version's functionality includes:
1. Populating the home page with data using server requests.
2. Comment section that allows users to post comments to the server.
3. Upload page that behaves somewhat as if it allows you to upload videos.

In sprint three more functionality will be added to Brainflix.
